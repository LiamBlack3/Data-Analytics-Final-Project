```
Rwandan Demographic and Health Survey

The data was collected by the DHS program, and this data set shows public health indicators such as access to health care and HIV positivity rates. We would like to explore the relationship that these variables cotain, and specificially the type of correlation. We expect to see a strong negative correlation bewteen the variables. In places with higher access to healthcare we belive there will be less cases of HIV. We also belive that this data set will help us understand underlying factors as well that might add to answering our question. We submitted a request for this data set and recived word that it will take 2 buisness days to come to us.
